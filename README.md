# propitious-wookie

Coding test submission for the VOA project. Repo name suggested by GitHub.

## Notes and Assumptions
* This is the first time I have used Play.
* I had one evening and one morning in which to learn Play and complete the test submission before the deadline.
* Therefore, I've left out: DB integration, pretty CSS/Bootstrap, AJAX/Comet/WebSockets.
* Most of my time was spent learning how to wire stuff together.
* If I took it further, my next step would be to work out how to mock application state (like the list of Vehicles) so that my tests were independent.
* My previous Scala web frameworks experience: Lift, Spray, Finatra, Naive-http

## Instructions
* Clone locally
* ```sbt```
* ```~ run```
* Go to http://localhost:9000

## Observations
* Good IntelliJ integration with Play, e.g. template parsing and directory structure awareness
* Is Play the new Spring?
* F5-style development encourage small, committable increments

## My Personal Open Source Projects / Hobbies
 * Executable documentation / specification-driven design - https://github.com/agmenc/pettswood
 * Making RESTful (-ish) servers trivial in Scala - https://github.com/agmenc/trivial-rest
 * Making reporting (e.g. regulatory trade reports) a non-headache - https://github.com/agmenc/planet7
