Coding test submission for the VOA project

## Notes and Assumptions
* This is the first time I have used Play. Previously, I have used the Scala web frameworks Lift, Spray, Finatra and Naive-http. I am currently learning Elm, which fits nicely into the new reactive paradigm espoused by the Scala community (and pretty much every other community).
* I've used sbt to create my Play application, not the Typesafe Activator or Play itself. This goes against most of the tutorials, but seemed MUCH neater, with fewer moving parts.
* I had one evening and one morning in which to learn Play and complete the test submission. I've left out DB integration and pretty CSS/Bootstrap.

## Instructions
* Clone locally
* ```sbt```
* ```~ run```
* Go to http://localhost:9000

## Observations
* Good IntelliJ integration with Play, e.g. template parsing and directory structure awareness
* Is Play the new Spring?
