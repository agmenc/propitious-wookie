# propitious-wookie

Coding test submission for the VOA project. Repo name suggested by GitHub.

## Notes and Assumptions
* This is the first time I have used Play.
* I had one evening and one morning in which to learn Play and complete the test submission before the deadline. I've left out DB integration and pretty CSS/Bootstrap.
* Most of my time was spent learning how to wire stuff together
* My previous Scala web frameworks experience: Lift, Spray, Finatra, Naive-http

## Instructions
* Clone locally
* ```sbt```
* ```~ run```
* Go to http://localhost:9000

## Observations
* Good IntelliJ integration with Play, e.g. template parsing and directory structure awareness
* Is Play the new Spring?
